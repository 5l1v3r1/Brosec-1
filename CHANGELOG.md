# ChangeLog

## 1.2.0 _(August 11, 2016)_

  - bros http
    - Added a simple file upload at /upload

- Payloads
  - Added ```Add user to remote desktop group``` to ```bros 31``` category
  - Added prompts to several bros 31 (Windows System Info) payloads.
- Bug Fixes!
  - Fixed an issue that would cause Brosec to prematurely exit when a payload with a menu option value greater than 9 was requested from the command line. For example, the <code>bros 3</code>  > <code>1</code> > <code>11</code>  payload (Windows payload to search the registry for a specific value) would exit prematurely if <code>bros 3111</code> was entered from the command line.
  - Minor fixes to a few Windows payloads that were using a deprecated Brosec syntax

## 1.1.5 _(August 4, 2016)_

  - Brosec variable values will be copied to the clipboard when retrieved. For example, running ```bros lhost``` from the command line will retrieve the LHOST variable, and copy it to your clipboard.
- Bug fixes!
- Improved error handling
- Cleaned up output
  - Removed the ```Output copied to clipboard!``` message to reduce clutter.

## Major Release 1.1.1 _(July 30, 2016)_

- Features
  - <strong>Full Windows Support added</strong>
  - Better documentation added to the new  [wiki](https://github.com/gabemarshall/Brosec/wiki)
  - Simplified install process. Once you have nodejs installed just run ```npm install -g Brosec```
  - ```bros encode``` module added (realtime encoder/decoder)
  - ```bros ftp``` now supports auth via ```--username``` and ```--password``` parameters.

- Dependencies
  - Removed kexec dependency that was used to run netcat listeners (replaced by ```modules/nc.js```) -- this greatly reduces the complexity of Brosec and makes it easier to install.


- Bug fixes
  - Lots and lots of bug fixes...and probably new bugs introduced ;p

## 1.0.2b _(Feb 16, 2016)_

- Features
    - `bros update`

- Features
    - `bros clean`
        - New feature added to allow quick deletion of the local Brosec database.

## 1.0.2 _(Feb 5, 2016)_

    - `bros set lhost`
    	- This feature (ran from the command line) will help you set the LHOST variable by prompting you with the available list of network interfaces.

## 0.1a _(August 15, 2015)_

    - `bros http <port (default 8000)>`
        - New feature added to allow for a simple web server similar to running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. SSL supprt is included via `bros https`
